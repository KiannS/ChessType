                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        ChessType is an AI-powered chess analysis tool that uses machine learning to identify your unique playing style. By analyzing your games from Chess.com or Lichess, we can classify you into one of five playing styles (Positional, Aggressive, Tactical, Solid, or Balanced) and provide personalized recommendations for improvement.

                    <div class="faq-question">How does it work?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        ChessType uses trained machine learning models (Random Forest classifiers and K-Means clustering) to analyze your games. We extract features like piece activity, pawn structure, center control, tactical patterns, and position types. These features are then compared against patterns from professional players to determine your style and strengths.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How many games do I need?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        For the best results, we recommend having at least 20-50 rated games. The more games you have, the more accurate the analysis will be. We analyze up to 1000 of your most recent games to get a comprehensive picture of your playing style.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <strong>Positional:</strong> Emphasizes long-term planning and strategic maneuvering (like Magnus Carlsen)<br>
                        <strong>Aggressive:</strong> Focuses on initiative, attacking, and creating threats (like Hikaru Nakamura)<br>
                        <strong>Tactical:</strong> Excels at combinations and sharp calculations (like Mikhail Tal)<br>
                        <strong>Solid:</strong> Plays reliably with minimal mistakes and strong defense (like Fabiano Caruana)<br>
                        <strong>Balanced:</strong> Adapts to positions with well-rounded skills (like Levon Aronian)

                    <div class="faq-question">Is my data safe?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes! We only access publicly available game data from Chess.com and Lichess using their official APIs. We don't store your games or personal information. All analysis is performed in real-time and not saved on our servers.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Which platforms are supported?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Currently, we support Chess.com and Lichess. Both platforms provide free APIs that allow us to access your public game history. You don't need a premium account on either platform.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How accurate is the analysis?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Our models have been trained on thousands of games from professional players and achieve approximately 75-80% accuracy in style classification. Position type classification achieves around 70-75% accuracy. Remember that playing styles can be fluid and may change over time or based on time controls.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I analyze bullet or blitz games?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Yes! We analyze all time controls including bullet, blitz, rapid, and classical games. However, keep in mind that your style might differ between time controls. For the most comprehensive analysis, we recommend having games in multiple time controls.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why is my analysis taking so long?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        Analysis time depends on how many games you have and the current server load. Typically, analyzing 50-100 games takes 30-90 seconds. For larger game collections (500+ games), it may take 2-3 minutes. We're downloading games from the platform APIs, extracting features, and running ML models - all in real-time!
